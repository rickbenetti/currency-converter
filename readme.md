# CCPanel - Currency Converter Panel

It's a panel to be updated about currencies in the world in steps
like EUR to USD to BRL with possibility to add a tax or taxes
to help how cost something or if is a good moment to buy another
currency.

The first idea is add this panel only to Google Chrome Extension,
maybe I go to Apple ecosystem and Android ecosystem, but before
this I will add all wireframes, prototypes and designs to guide
what I spect to do and what I need learn.
